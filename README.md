# RSA-Encryption-Decryption
This code implements RSA encryption and decryption with key generation. It includes an extended Euclidean algorithm to compute modular inverses for private key generation, genPrivateKey(), and functions to encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA, encryptRSA() and decryptRSA(). main() tests the key generation, against provided test cases.
